<h2 id="why-do-some-of-your-neighbors-live-in-tents">Why do some of your neighbors live in tents?</h2>
<p>Washington, D.C. has one of the highest rates of people who are unhoused in any city in the United States.</p>
<p>D.C. is one of the most expensive cities in the United States, and rental prices have been steadily increasing for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>People who are unhoused often have become displaced because of low wages and high rents.</p>
<p>According to the 1981 Census and most modern-day guidelines, Americans should spend no more than 30% of their income on housing.</p>
<p>To meet this goal of spending only 30% of their income on housing, a person working full time in D.C. at the minimum wage of $15/hour would need to work 159 hours a week to afford the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>On average, a two-bedroom apartment in D.C. goes for $3100/month.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, paying rent and bills is more difficult because of the COVID-19 pandemic. If people aren’t working, they cannot pay their bills, including their rent. Even with the current moratorium on evictions in D.C. until at least December 31, 2020, housing advocates are expecting a housing crisis with many more D.C. residents becoming unhoused once that moratorium is lifted.</p>
