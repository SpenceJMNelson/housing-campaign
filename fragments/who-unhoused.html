When you picture someone who is unhoused, what does that person look like in your mind?
(Holly: I think this is going to lend itself well to a graphic with the numbers instead of text as I have here. I have included percentages and raw numbers so we can decide which is the most powerful.)

Let’s compare what you have just imagined in your mind to what was found in the January 2020 count and survey of people who were unhoused in D.C.

D.C. Statistics, in order of prevalence/dominance by a specific subpopulation:
Black people who are unhoused: 5,551 people (87% of the unhoused population)

Identify as male (adults only): 3,810 (77% of adults who are unhoused)

Unaccompanied/living unhoused without a family: 3,935 adults (62% of the unhoused population), 12 unaccompanied minors (<1% of the unhoused population)

Adults who are unhoused and have previously lived in an institutional setting (which includes incarceration): 1,994 adults who are unhoused (40% of adults who are unhoused)
Formerly incarcerated people living in the United States are almost 10 times more likely to be unhoused than the general public

Adults who are chronically unhoused: 1,695 adults who are unhoused are experiencing chronic homelessness (34% of all adults who are unhoused; 42% of unaccompanied adults who are unhoused and 6% of adults who are unhoused with their families)
Chronic homelessness is defined by HUD as: “persons who have experienced homelessness for a year or more, or who have had four or more episodes of homelessness in three years (which total at least 12 months), and who are living with a disabling condition. Families are considered to be experiencing chronic homelessness if at least one adult person in the household meets the definition of chronic homelessness.”
