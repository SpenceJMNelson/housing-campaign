<h3 id="who-is-serve-your-cityward-6-mutual-aid">Who is Serve Your City/Ward 6 Mutual Aid?</h3>
<p>Serve Your City’s mission is to provide life-changing experiences and opportunities for under-resourced Washington, D.C. students. It aims to make sure Black and Brown students receive the same opportunities their White counterparts receive. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SYC co-created the DC Mutual Aid Network, which is the central and only mutual aid network in the city, and is acting as the lead organizer for mutual aid in Ward 6 and beyond. With dozens of mostly Black- and Brown-led community organizations leading the work, the DC Mutual Aid Network is a community-led effort to safely support community members hardest hit by the pandemic. The network is a grassroots, trauma-informed response to the pandemic for the most vulnerable and under-resourced communities in Washington, DC. Members of these communities are disproportionately African Americans, People of Color, and those who have recently immigrated to the United States, and bear the burden of systemic poverty, racism, and environmental injustice. The mutual aid network is providing life-saving supplies, food, and PPE. You can read more about our mutual aid programming <a href="http://serveyourcitydc.org/programs">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="our-encampment-work">Our Encampment Work</h3>
<p>An increasing number of DC residents are without access to shelter, food, and basic hygiene necessities. COVID-19 has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and increased the urgency for access to face masks, disposable gloves, and basic hygiene products. Serve Your City/Ward 6 Mutual Aid is working with our partners, The People for Fairness Coalition and the Gonzaga Peace Club, to provide relief to DC residents living in encampments, including: weekly deliveries of socks, wipes, hand sanitizer, toilet paper, hygiene products, face masks, disposable gloves, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Masks for Ward 6 Unhoused Neighbors:</strong> This pandemic continues to push more of our neighbors out of their homes. In addition to the basic supplies listed above, one of the most requested items is high-quality masks. Serve Your City/Ward 6 Mutual Aid is seeking businesses to sponsor masks that can be distributed to our neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>All sponsors will be thanked specifically at your level of support in our e-newsletter and on our social media platforms. We are happy to have a conversation about other needs from your end.</strong> For all questions or to sign up to be a sponsor, please contact Hannah Jacobson Blumenfeld at <a href="mailto:hannah@serveyourcitydc.org">hannah@serveyourcitydc.org</a>.</p>

<p>SYC was born as a response to rapid gentrification in Washington, D.C.’s communities. One of the outcomes of the city’s changing demographics has been increasing privatization of programs such as arts and athletics. SYC’s programming addresses both health and economic disparities. Over the past eight years, we have helped underserved students in grades 7 - 12 in D.C.'s Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8 experience sports they typically do not have access to; and now, the digital divide is making distance education similarly inaccessible to our Black and Brown students. We know that racist policies have kept children of color from accessing these activities, and our work today, while limited by the pandemic, seeks to address and repair disparities for all children and families. Our goal is to disrupt these systems by providing access to equipment and safe environments with trusted adults who provide high-quality education.</p>
<p>When not faced with a global pandemic, SYC provides programs that include 1) tutoring and college preparatory workshops; 2) the only majority Black youth rowing crew in Washington, D.C.; 3) yoga developed for youth of color; 4) water sports, including swimming lessons, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving instruction; and 5) financial literacy and college preparatory workshops. Given the health emergency, SYC immediately shifted its focus to ensuring that its students and the communities they live in have the resources needed to weather the pandemic and combat the systems that created the crisis.</p>
<p>The DC Mutual Aid Network is serving 2,000 community members per week by providing food, cleaning and personal hygiene supplies, and other household items. In addition to SYC’s work providing urgently needed food to families, the program has matched students with mentors, provided students with devices and hotspots so they may access the internet and online instruction, and has produced a Black public health campaign to educate the community about COVID-19 in a culturally sensitive manner. The theme of this work is “We Keep Us Safe.” SYC/Ward 6 Mutual Aid works with more than <a href="http://serveyourcitydc.org/about">35 grassroots partner organizations</a> to ensure that this work is community-led and sustainable.</p>
