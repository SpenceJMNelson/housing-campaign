When you see a stranger panhandling, what do you assume about that person?

You may assume they are unhoused, a drug addict or an alcoholic, lazy, unemployed, or suffering from a mental/physical illness.

You may assume this person doesn’t want to work hard and doesn’t want to get an “honest” job.

Maybe you think this person is “using” or “conning” generous people who give them money. You may think their panhandling is a “scam.”

All of your assumptions about this person are based on one behavior you observed. You don’t actually know anything about this person or their life.

Without knowing the person who is panhandling, you may be making a lot of negative assumptions about them and judging their situation.

If you were unable to hold a job for any reason, what would you do?

If you were unhoused, couldn’t get a job, and needed money to eat, would you be behaving any differently?
