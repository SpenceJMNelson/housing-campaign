Do drug users deserve a safe place to live?

Yes. All people deserve a safe place to live, regardless of who they are and what they do.

Only 18.4% of adults who are unhoused in D.C. report having substance use problems.

People who are unhoused with a history of substance use - and especially those with drug convictions on their record - face additional barriers to affordable housing.
Housing assistance programs, like voucher programs and HUD-assisted housing limit the type of support available to people with substance use problems.
Some programs may completely deny people with substance use problems.

Without a safe place to live, our neighbors who are unhoused and using substances often find it difficult to address their substance use, whether that be managing their use or getting clean.

Without a safe place to live, the stress of housing insecurity can also lead to new substance use, an increase in substance use, or relapse.
