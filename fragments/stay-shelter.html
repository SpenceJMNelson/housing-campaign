Why do some people who are unhoused not want to stay in a shelter?

There are many reasons why someone who is unhoused would not want to stay in a shelter. What reasons might those be? Why might someone prefer an encampment with their own tent over a shelter?

In a shelter there can be a higher likelihood of theft or assault, whether it is between people who are staying in the shelter or perpetuated by shelter staff.

Some people do not want to stay in a shelter because they want their independence. They do not want to have to adhere to a shelter’s rules and curfews. After all, most of our unhoused neighbors are adults and they want to be treated as such.

Sometimes shelters are not the best places to provide appropriate services and care to people with chronic mental health issues or with substance use issues.
If a person who is unhoused has unaddressed substance use problems and a shelter requires sobriety, a shelter is probably not their first choice for a place to stay.

If you need a service animal to assist you, many shelters do not permit pets, despite ADA requirements.

Shelters aren’t always hygienic and due to crowding can lead to transmission of pests like lice or bed bugs or diseases like tuberculosis or COVID-19.

Especially now, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a shelter can be a risky place to stay.
Many shelters are unable to accommodate social distancing.
Some people have reported that in D.C. shelters they can reach out from their bed and touch the person next to them.
Often staff will withhold donated masks, PPE, and food to the people staying in the shelters.
