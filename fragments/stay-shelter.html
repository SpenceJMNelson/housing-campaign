<p>There are many reasons why someone who is unhoused would not want to stay in a shelter. What reasons might those be? Why might someone prefer an encampment with their own tent over a shelter?</p>
<p>In a shelter there can be a higher likelihood of theft or assault, whether it is between people who are staying in the shelter or perpetuated by shelter staff.</p>
<p>Some people do not want to stay in a shelter because they want their independence. They do not want to have to adhere to a shelter’s rules and curfews. After all, most of our unhoused neighbors are adults and they want to be treated as such.</p>
<p>Sometimes shelters are not the best places to provide appropriate services and care to people with chronic mental health issues or with substance use issues.<br>
If a person who is unhoused has unaddressed substance use problems and a shelter requires sobriety, a shelter is probably not their first choice for a place to stay.</p>
<p>If you need a service animal to assist you, many shelters do not permit pets, despite ADA requirements.</p>
<p>Shelters aren’t always hygienic and due to crowding can lead to transmission of pests like lice or bed bugs or diseases like tuberculosis or COVID-19.</p>
