<h2>Why do some of your neighbors live in tents?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Washington, D.C. has one of the highest rates of people who are unhoused in any city in the United States.</li>
<li>D.C. is one of the most expensive cities in the United States, and rental prices have been steadily increasing for the last 10 years.</li>
<li>People who are unhoused often have become displaced because of low wages and high rents.</li>
<li>According to the 1981 Census and most modern day guidelines, Americans should spend no more than 30% of their income on housing.</li>
<li>To meet this goal of spending only 30% of their income on housing, a person working full time in D.C. at the minimum wage of $15/hour would need to work 159 hours a week to afford the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment.</li>
<li>On average, a two-bedroom apartment in D.C. goes for $3100/month.</li>
<li>Now more than ever, paying rent and bills is more difficult because of the COVID-19 pandemic. If people arenâ€™t working, they cannot pay their bills, including their rent. Even with the current moratorium on evictions in D.C. until at least December 31, 2020, housing advocates are expecting a housing crisis with many more D.C. residents becoming unhoused once that moratorium is lifted.</li>
